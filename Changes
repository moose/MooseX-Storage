0.26
  * Fix URI for repository in metadata.
  * Fix infinite recursion when collapsing objects which overload stringify
    to freeze themselves.

0.25
  * Add support for Union types (bumps Moose dep to 0.99)

0.24
  * Add additional YAML implementation tests.
  * Switch from using Best to YAML::Any.

0.23
  * Revert whitespace change in tests which breaks the tests if you
    have Test::YAML::Valid installed.

0.22
  * Fix warnings when types do not have a parent type.
  * allow the use of roles outside MooseX::Storage:: (rjbs)

0.21
  * Fix inconsistent dist versions with Perl::Version

0.20
  * Add support for Storage( traits => [...] ) with a MooseX::Storage::Traits::XX
    namespace to alter the behaviour of the storage engine.
    (Suggestions for how to make this less fugly appreciated)
  * Add feature to disable cycle checking, either via engine trait or option
    * add docs & tests (including 1 TODO test)
  * Add feature to only serialize attributes whose predicate returns 'true'
  * Implement the unpack( $data, inject => {...} ) feature.
    * add docs & tests
  * Move Base::WithChecksum to build upon Basic.pm, avoid code duplication
  * Add extra test to ensure restoring fails if required argument isn't provided
  * Fix a bug where if a required constructor argument was not serialized, it was
    impossible to ->unpack again.

0.19
  * Skip pod tests when not in author mode

0.18
   * Fix test failures without JSON::Any. Patch from RT#46343 (Nicholas Clarke)
   * Added support for Maybe[...] constraints fixing RT#43165 (plu)

0.17
   * Change MooseX::Storage::Engine to use get_all_attributes,
     rather than the deprecated compute_all_applicable_attributes (t0m)

0.16
   * Don't fail tests when Best is unavailable (t0m)

0.15
    * MooseX::Storage
      - Remove use of deprecated alias_method routine
        which was causing issues when you used multiple
        Roles which used MooseX::Storage (t0m).

0.14
    * MooseX::Storage::Engine
      - cycles are now tracked by refaddr instead 
        of stringified object, which broke for any
        overloaded objects (Thanks to Jonathan Rockway)

    * Don't fail tests when YAML is unavailable

    * Use temporary files in test suite, instead of cwd

0.13 Sat. May 24, 2008
    * MooseX::Storage::Engine
      - added find_type_handler_for($name) method 
        to make finding type handlers easier
      - improved error messages

    ~ removed Build.PL since Module::Install
      no longer supports it

0.12 Fri. March 14, 2008

    - added build_requires for Test::Deep (awwaiid)
    - upped the Moose dependency to support the custom
      meta-attribute-traits
    
    * t/
      - fixing all the tests to properly skip if optional 
        features are not being used, this should help get
        rid of all our CPANtester failures
        - tested against 5.10 as well
    
    * MooseX::Storage::Engine
      MooseX::Storage::Meta::Attribute::DoNotSerialize
      MooseX::Storage::Meta::Attribute::Trait::DoNotSerialize
      - adding meta-attribute-trait support for 
        DoNotSerialize
        - added tests for this

0.11 Thurs. Jan. 10, 2008

    - upped the Test::JSON dependency 
      so that we use the version that 
      supports JSON::Any
    - upped the JSON::Any requirement 
    - minor test cleanups to handle
      optional dependencies better

    * MooseX::Storage::Engine
      - the numbers now have to numify (+0) in the 
        expand/collapse so that certain JSON engines
        will not choke on them

0.10 Thurs. Jan. 10, 2008
    ~~ updated copyright information ~~

    * MooseX::Storage::Deferred
      - added this role, which allows you to wait until
        you actually call a method to determine what 
        formatter and/or IO engine you want to use
        - added tests for this

0.09 Tue. Oct. 23, 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Util
      - added support to deal with utf8 strings correctly
      
    * MooseX::Storage::Engine::File
      MooseX::Storage::Engine::AtomicFile
      - fixed utf8 handling when storing string
        - added tests for this
     
    * t/
      - added an extra test for the utf8 handling
    
    * Change build system to Module::Install

0.08 Wed. Oct. 10, 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Format::JSON
      - added support to deal with utf8 strings correctly

0.07 Thurs. Sept. 27, 2007
    + MooseX::Storage::Format::Storable
      - this will use Storable to freeze/thaw objects
        - added tests for this
    
    + MooseX::Storage::IO::StorableFile
      - this will use Storable to load/store objects    
        - added tests for this

    * t/
      - fixed tests in 030_with_checksum.t
        (thanks to sartak)

0.06 Tues. Aug. 7, 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Engine
      - added the Bool type and fixed a few bugs
        that it exposed (thanks to Sartak)
        - added tests for this

0.05 Sun. July 15. 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Base::WithChecksum
      - Fixed minor issue where the WithChecksum would 
        choke with a bad checksum due to odd Data::Dumper
        output.
    
    * t/
      - forced JSON::Any in the basic JSON tests to use 
        JSON.pm since this is what Test::JSON uses and 
        subtle (and annoying) issues can arise.

0.04 Tues. July 3, 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Util
        - made this more robust when it tries
          to use YAML and JSON loaders and fails
          to find one
            - fixed tests to reflect this

0.03 Wed. June 27, 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Util
        - this is a collection of useful tools 
          for working with MooseX::Storage data
            - added docs and test

    * t/
        - added test for a custom type handler
        - fixed checksum test to skip if Digest::SHA1 
          (our default) is not available

0.02 Fri. June 8, 2007
    * MooseX::Storage::Base::WithChecksum
      - added a simple base role which makes a checksum of 
        the data structure before packing, and checks the
        checksum before unpacking.
        - added tests for this

    * MooseX::Storage::Engine
      - better error reporting when cycles are found
      - class names are now stored as the full identifier
        (<class>-<version>-<authority>) and are checked
        when they are expanded.
        - added docs and tests for this

    * MooseX::Storage::Engine::IO::(AtomicFile, File)
      - added checks to make sure the file gets opened correctly
        and dies if it does not.

0.01  Mon. April 30, 2007
    This was Chris's idea originally (blame him), and 
    we expanded on it to create what you see here :)
