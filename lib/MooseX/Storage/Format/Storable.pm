=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Point;
  use Moose;
  use MooseX::Storage;

  with Storage('format' => 'Storable');

  has 'x' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');
  has 'y' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');

  1;

  my $p = Point->new(x => 10, y => 10);

  ## methods to freeze/thaw into
  ## a specified serialization format

  # pack the class with Storable
  my $storable_data = $p->freeze();

  # unpack the storable data into the class
  my $p2 = Point->thaw($storable_data);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for stopwords IPC

This module will C<thaw> and C<freeze> Moose classes using Storable. It
uses C<Storable::nfreeze> by default so that it can be easily used
in IPC scenarios across machines or just locally.

=for stopwords Storable's

One important thing to note is that this module does not mix well
with the IO modules. The structures that C<freeze> and C<thaw> deal with
are Storable's memory representation, and (as far as I know) that
is not easily just written onto a file. If you want file based
serialization with Storable, the please look at the
L<MooseX::Storage::IO::StorableFile> role instead.
