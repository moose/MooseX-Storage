=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a set of tools, some sharp and focused,
others more blunt and crude. But no matter what, they are useful
bits to have around when dealing with MooseX::Storage code.

=head1 METHODS

All the methods in this package are class methods and should
be called appropriately.

=over 4

=item B<peek ($data, %options)>

This method will help you to verify that the serialized class you
have gotten is what you expect it to be before you actually
unfreeze/unpack it.

The C<$data> can be either a perl HASH ref or some kind of serialized
data (JSON, YAML, etc.).

The C<%options> are as follows:

=over 4

=item I<format>

If this is left blank, we assume that C<$data> is a plain perl HASH ref
otherwise we attempt to inflate C<$data> based on the value of this option.

Currently only JSON and YAML are supported here.

=item I<key>

The default is to try and extract the class name, but if you want to check
another key in the data, you can set this option. It will return the value
found in the key for you.
