=head1 SYNOPSIS

    {   package Point;
        use Moose;
        use MooseX::Storage;

        with Storage( traits => [qw|OnlyWhenBuilt|] );

        has 'x' => (is => 'rw', lazy_build => 1 );
        has 'y' => (is => 'rw', predicate => '_has_y' );
        has 'z' => (is => 'rw', builder => '_build_z' );

        sub _build_x { 3 }
        sub _build_y { expensive_computation() }
        sub _build_z { 3 }
    }

    my $p = Point->new( 'x' => 4 );

    # the result of ->pack will contain:
    # { x => 4, z => 3 }
    $p->pack;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you don't want a particular attribute to be part of the
serialization if it has not been built yet. If you invoke C<Storage()>
as outlined in the C<Synopsis>, only attributes that have been built
(i.e., where the predicate returns 'true') will be serialized.
This avoids any potentially expensive computations.

This trait is applied to an instance of L<MooseX::Storage::Engine>, for the
user-visible version shown in the SYNOPSIS, see L<MooseX::Storage::Traits::OnlyWhenBuilt>
